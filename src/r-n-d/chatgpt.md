## 📖 Clarification of Usage/Implementation
I **did not buy a personal subscription**, nor could I find one online for **free** (whether that be through *Discord* or *Reddit*).  Currently when the Chatbot prompts for an API, my **free** secret key **works**, but I **do not have any funds**, therefore it returns and **insufficient funding error**.

*Please refer to README on how to utilize the chatbot.*
