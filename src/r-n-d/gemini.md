## 🔎 Reasearch
* **API Key**: This Chatbot offers you the avaliability to **create and delete** secret/API keys at will.  You must have already created a project in *Google Cloud*, because it **will not** let you create a project if you are utilizing the **free*** version.
* **Cost**:  *Gemini* is a **free** to use API key generator and has useful tool utilization for ***USD* student/faculty** accounts.
    * The typical **free** *Gemini* subscription allows you **$300** in credit to perform tasks such as: creating projects in *Google Cloud* and creating API Keys in *Google AI Studio*, but it requires you to enter **billing information**.

## 📖 Clarification of Usage/Implementation
I **did not buy a personal subscription**, nor did I enter my **billing information** (which sounds like an excuse), but I was *uncomfortable* with creating a subscription for **free** that asked for my **credit information**.

This project was chosen then to utilize *ChatGPT* due to its **popularity** and the **higher likelihood** more people will have a **subscription** or API key for this tool.

*Please refer to README on how to utilize the chatbot.*
